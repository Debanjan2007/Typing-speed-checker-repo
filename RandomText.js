    1 : "Quantum physics is a branch of physics that explores the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales—specifically, at the level of atoms and subatomic particles. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics reveals that particles can exist in multiple states at once (superposition) and that their properties are fundamentally probabilistic rather than deterministic. Key concepts include wave-particle duality, quantum entanglement, and uncertainty. Quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and has applications in technologies like quantum computing, cryptography, and medical imaging.",
    2 : "The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is India's national space agency, renowned for its advancements in space exploration, satellite development, and space research. Founded in 1969, ISRO has made significant strides in space technology, launching satellites for communication, weather forecasting, and navigation. It gained global attention with missions like Chandrayaan (India's lunar exploration program) and Mangalyaan (India's Mars Orbiter Mission), becoming the first country to reach Mars on its maiden attempt. ISRO is also known for its cost-effective missions and is a major player in the global space industry.",
    3 : "The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is a highly successful launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). First launched in 1993, PSLV has become ISRO's workhorse for deploying satellites into polar, geostationary, and low Earth orbits. It is known for its reliability and versatility, with the capability to carry multiple satellites in a single mission. The PSLV has been used for significant missions like launching India's Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan, as well as deploying numerous international satellites, establishing ISRO as a key player in the global space launch market.",
    4 : "Adolf Hitler was a German politician and dictator who led the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party) and became Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He later assumed the title of Führer, establishing a totalitarian regime. Hitler's aggressive expansionist policies led to World War II, and his ideology of Aryan racial superiority resulted in the Holocaust, where millions of Jews and other minorities were systematically persecuted and murdered. Hitler's reign ended in 1945 with Germany's defeat in the war, and he died by suicide in his Berlin bunker. His legacy is one of destruction and atrocity.",
    5 : "Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining code that enables computers and software to perform specific tasks. It involves using programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript to communicate instructions to a machine. Programmers create algorithms and solve problems through logical thinking and coding, which can range from developing applications and websites to controlling hardware and managing data. Programming plays a critical role in technology, powering everything from smartphones and websites to artificial intelligence and automation systems. It's a foundational skill in today's digital world.",
